# fastest.route
Return the path and time for each transport provider between 2 cities. The shortest path is calculated by the distance between the bodes.

The shortes path can be calculated using time instead of distance between nodes with a small change in the code.

Returns also the shortest path if you can switch transport provider at nodes.
